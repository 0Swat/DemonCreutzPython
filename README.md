# Project Title: Demon Energy and System Magnetization Simulation

## Description

This Python project simulates the interaction between a system's energy and a demon (an abstract entity used in computational physics to exchange energy with the system) in a discrete 2D lattice. The simulation explores the concept of energy conservation and distribution within a defined grid, examining how varying the "demon's energy" affects the system's overall energy and magnetization. Key features include energy calculations, magnetization tracking, energy histograms, and temperature dependence of average magnetization.

## Features

-   Simulation of energy exchange in a 2D lattice system.
-   Tracking of system energy, demon energy, and system magnetization over iterations.
-   Generation of energy histograms before and after stabilization.
-   Calculation of system's average magnetization and its dependence on temperature.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.x
-   Matplotlib
-   Numpy

Ensure these are installed and up to date in your Python environment.

## Installation

No special installation is required. Just ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can clone this repository or download the script directly.

## Usage

To run the simulation, navigate to the directory containing the script and execute:

shell

`python <script_name>.py` 

Replace `<script_name>` with the actual name of the Python script.

The script parameters (such as grid size, number of iterations, and demon energy levels) can be adjusted within the script itself to explore different simulation outcomes.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! Whether it's improving the simulation accuracy, optimizing the code, or adding new features, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
